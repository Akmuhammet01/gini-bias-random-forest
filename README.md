# Gini Bias in Random Forest Models

## Overview
This repository investigates Gini bias in Random Forest feature importance metrics, comparing methods like Gini Importance, Permutation Importance, Drop-Column Importance, and Actual Impurity Reduction (AIR). The primary goal is to transfer R-based solutions (e.g., AIR) to Python.
